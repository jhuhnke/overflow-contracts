# zk Reputation SUI Move Contracts
zk Reputation leverages the power of zero-knowledge proofs and the SUI blockchain to enhance the privacy of on-chain identity documents and reputation scores.

These smart contracts are deployed publically, allowing anyone to view and verify the code. All assets are represented on-chain as objects, allowing SUI projects and developers to seemlessly integrate zk Reputation credentials into their application.  

## Contracts 

**Certificates**
- Identity Certificate: Your IRL identity, verified and stored on-chain. 
- Social Certificate: Proof of social media account ownership.
- Credit Score Certificate: A credit score issued based solely off of on-chain lending activity. 
- DAO Certificate: Create your own DAO and assign roles to members fully on-chain. 

**ZK Proofs**
- Proof Policy: Ensures the transfer policy has been met before allowing the transfer of a certificate. 
- Verifier: Functions for verifying Groth16 proofs. 
- Helpers: Logs object IDs and streamlines the process of proving and cliaming transfer requests. 
- Utils: Provides utility functions for managing assets, kiosks, transfer policies, and unlockers.
